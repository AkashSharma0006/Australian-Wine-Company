# Australian-Wine-Company


I am excited to share my latest project, a Tableau dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the Australian Wine Company's sales performance across different regions and product categories.

The dashboard includes the following key insights:

Total revenue, order quantity, customer count, freight mode, and region
Region and subsegment revenue analysis
Top 10 cities by revenue
Revenue by states
The dashboard is easy to use and interactive, allowing you to drill down into the data to explore specific trends and patterns.

For example, you can see that the South region is the highest-performing region for the Australian Wine Company, accounting for over 30% of total revenue. The Pinot Gris grape variety is the most popular subsegment in the South region, followed by Champagne and Grenache Rose.

The dashboard also shows that the top 10 cities by revenue are all located in the South and East regions. Canberra is the top-performing city, followed by Bunbury and Palmerston.

Overall, the Australian Wine Company is performing well across all regions and product categories. The dashboard provides valuable insights that can help the company make informed decisions about its sales and marketing strategies.
